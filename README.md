A cryptographically secure Node.js random generator for real English words. Contains over 350,000 English words.

**Note:** Rword stores its words array in memory, and limited testing shows this to add about ~20-60 MB to Node's heap depending on which word list you choose. Rword is built to be fast and self-contained without the need for a database and this price is paid at the expense of your RAM.

```
npm install rword
```

# Examples

```ts
import { Rword } from 'rword';
```

**Generate random words:**

```ts
const rword = new Rword('small');
rword.generate(); // ['pocketful']
rword.generate(4); // ['disrupter', 'recognizes', 'unbuckle', 'responding']
```

**Generate reproducible words from a custom seed:**

```ts
const seedRword1 = new Rword('big', 'your_custom_seed_123');
seedRword1.generate(3); // ['abandon', 'gunpowder', 'pole']
const seedRword2 = new Rword('big', 'your_custom_seed_123');
seedRword2.generate(3); // ['abandon', 'gunpowder', 'pole']
```

# Words

Rword comes with two word lists: `small`, with ~123k words, and `big`, with ~350k. By default, Rword uses `small`.

All of the words contain _only_ `a-z` characters. There are no numbers, symbols, spaces, or diacritics.

`small` contains only words 3-10 characters in length, while `big` has no length requirements.

`small` is likely to decrease in size in the future, while `big` may increase.

# API

## `rword = new Rword(list, seed)`

Creates an instance of Rword with the specified word list and optional seed.

- `list: "big" | "small"` - The list to load into the Rword instance.
- `seed?: string` - Optional - By providing a seed, you ensure that the sequence of random words generated by the instance is reproducible. This means that if you create two instances of Rword with the same word list and seed, they will generate the same sequence of words.

## `rword.generate(length)`

Generates words from the instance's words array.

- `length: number` - Optional (default `1`) - How many words to return

You may be tempted to use the shorthand `new Rword('small').generate()` as needed, but this is _not_ recommended because creating an Rword instance causes the entire word list to be loaded and shuffled. It's recommended to keep and reuse as few instances as possible.

## `rword.shuffle()`

Shuffles the instance's words array. This method is automatically called upon instantiation.

## `rword.getWords()`

Returns the full (shuffled) words array used internally by the Rword instance.
